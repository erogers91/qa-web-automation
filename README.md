#  QA Web Automation (Playwright + Yarn)

This project is a starter automation framework for **React/Web apps** using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).  
It includes Page Object Models, role-based tests, environment variables, and GitHub Actions CI integration.

---

## Features
- End-to-end UI tests with [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
- **Page Object Model (POM)** structure for maintainability.
- Role-based testing with entitlements (`admin` vs `user`).
- Environment variable support (`.env` for local, GitHub Secrets for CI).
- GitHub Actions workflow for **CI/CD**.
- HTML reports with test results, screenshots, and traces.

yarn test

Run in headed mode:
yarn test:headed

Open the Playwright Test UI:
yarn test:ui

View HTML report:
yarn report

### 4. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml
